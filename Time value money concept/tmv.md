## COMPOUNDING

example:
saving a 100$ one at interest rate of 3% p.a vs saving 100$ at 3% p.a , how much do you have at the end of the periods?

- The total amount gotten after saving the amount in the stipulated time is called future value(FV)
- The amount at present is the present value(PV)
- R is the interest rate (per period)
- n is the number of periods
  FV=PV(1+r)^n

  FV=100(1+0.03)^1=100(1.03)=103
  FV=103

  FV=100(1+0.0.03)^3=100 \* 1.09=1.09
  FV=1.09

Assuming I need an interest of 110 how much do I need to save to get in one year working with an interest rate of 4.5%?

- in the given equatin we have the future and should work with it to get the present value
  PV=FV/(1+R)^n
  - PV=110/(1+0.045)^1
  - PV=105.26
